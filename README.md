## Introduction
CPC Project is A.I application to control the computer mouse pointer movement using eye's gaze, the project use Inference Engine API from Intel's OpenVINO ToolKit with python implementation. The four different pretrained models will run in the same machine; the gaze estimation model will use the results from the previous models to find the new mouse coordinates, the app then change the mouse pointer position accordingly.

## How it Works

The app will use a media file or webcam as input and capture frames, each frame is sent to face detection model, after some preprocessing it returns the cropped face, the cropped face is then sent to the head post estimation and facial landmarks detection models for further processing, the cropped eyes (left and right eyes) are returned by facial landmarks detection model while head pose estimation model returns head pose angles, these results are passed to the gaze estimation model where the returned coordinates will be used as new values for pointer and hence move the mouse position according to result.

## Benchmarks

I have Measured the performance of all possible combination i.e using multiple model precisions on the Intel® Core™ i5-6200U CPU and the log file is saved. see [stdout.log](./stdout.log)

## Results

In stdout.log file, we can see that the models loading time, frames per second and total inference time are all depends on the model precisions used.
fd=face detection model, fl=facial landmarks, hp=head pose e and ge=gaze estimation

let us take three combinations for example here is the results:

1. MODELS COMBINATION: fd, fl, hp, ge :  FP32-INT1 FP32 FP32 FP32

models loading time  :  0.44 \
frames per seconds   :  9.5 \
total inference time :  6.21

2. MODELS COMBINATION: fd, fl, hp, ge :  FP32-INT1 FP16 FP16 FP16

models loading time  :  0.47 \
frames per seconds   :  12.79 \
total inference time :  4.61 

3. MODELS COMBINATION: fd, fl, hp, ge :  FP32-INT1 FP32-INT8 FP32-INT8 FP32-INT8

models loading time  :  1.83 \
frames per seconds   :  9.24 \
total inference time :  6.39 


- Here we run our application using different precision of models, inference time in low precision models is faster. the model with high precision say FP32 will require more compution than FP16 and INT8 models, loading time is one time event and low value means it tooks less time to load a models, the fps and inference time of the low precision models are better, however, there are some trade-offs with accuracy when using lower precision, FP32 have a higher accuracy than others e.g: FP16. FP32 for example can be quantized into INT8 this will allow us to get faster inference but  with some drops in accuracy.

- the best precision combination is "FP32-INT1 FP16 FP16 FP16". FP32-INT1 will be used for face detection model while FP16 will be used for other models. by doing this we will maintain our system resources while having a good accuracy that is enough.


## Stand Out Suggestions

- User can shut off the output video by pressing q key. This will close the cv2 opened window and show a log info like this:

```
INFO:root:changing mouse position... moving
INFO:root:video window closed... to exit app, press CTRL+Z
INFO:root:changing mouse position... moving
INFO:root:changing mouse position... moving
```

- This app can handle image, video and webcam (i have added a code to preprocess the webcam since it is backwards/inverted)


### Async Inference
If you have used Async Inference in your code, benchmark the results and explain its effects on power and performance of your project.

### Edge Cases
There will be certain situations that will break your inference flow. For instance, lighting changes or multiple people in the frame. Explain some of the edge cases you encountered in your project and how you solved them to make your project more robust.

- The app used 60% as default probability threshold to ensure best result during face detection

- if the face is not detected either due to low light or other situations, the app output log info in terminal telling the user: No face detected. The app then skip the frame without feeding data to other models.

- user can also specify the probability threshold based on their need.

- when the app detects more than one face in frame, it will show a log warning in terminal and tell the user only one face will be used.

- If errors occur in other models after face detection results, the app shows info to the user, the frame is skipped and the mouse position remains unchanged.


## Conclusion

In this project, we used the gaze detection model to control the mouse pointer of computer. The Gaze Estimation model was used to estimate the gaze of the user's eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly. This project also demonstrate the ability to run multiple models in the same machine and coordinate the flow of data between those models.
